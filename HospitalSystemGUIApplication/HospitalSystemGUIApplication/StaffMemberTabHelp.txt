STAFF MEMBER TAB HELP

This tab is used to display the staff members held in the system

This functionality extends to displaying just doctors or just nurses.

Like the patient tab, you can search for a specific staff member by 
entering a unique staff number into the search box.

To clear the display box simply click on the clear button.
